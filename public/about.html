<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hey there! I’m Lavanya — college student, full-time curious person. I’m currently studying B.E - Computer Science Engineering at Anna University affiliated College, where I spend my days juggling lectures, projects, and the occasional caffeine-fueled brainstorm.</p>
<p>I’m fascinated by how technology can solve everyday problems, and I love turning ideas into things people can actually use or enjoy.Outside of class, you might catch me experimenting with new recipes.</p>
<p>I believe learning doesn’t stop at the classroom door — so this site is my little corner of the internet to share what I’m building, thinking, and discovering.If you’ve got a cool idea, a big question, or just a good book recommendation, my inbox is always open.</p>
